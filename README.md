# ðŸ“š Library Management System using DSA in Python

This is a **mini-project** that demonstrates core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts in Python by simulating a simple **Library Management System**.

The implementation covers:
- âœ… Lists
- âœ… Stacks
- âœ… Queues
- âœ… Linked Lists
- âœ… Hash Tables
- âœ… Trees
- âœ… Binary Trees (with in-order traversal)

## ðŸš€ Features by Steps

### --- Step 1: Books List ---
```python
['Hamlet', 'Rebecca', 'Dracula', 'Matilda', 'Frankenstein', 'Carrie', 'Emma']
--- Step 2: Stack (Undo Delete) ---
python
Copy code
Deleted book: Emma  
Undo delete: Emma added back  
['Hamlet', 'Rebecca', 'Dracula', 'Matilda', 'Frankenstein', 'Carrie', 'Emma']
--- Step 3: Queue (Borrow Requests) ---
python
Copy code
Borrow queue: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']  
Next to borrow: Alice  
Queue after serving: ['Bob', 'Charlie']
--- Step 4: Linked List (Borrowers) ---
python
Copy code
Hamlet => Rebecca => Dracula => Borrow
--- Step 5: Hash Table (Books by ID) ---
python
Copy code
Book 101: Hamlet  
Book 102: Rebecca  
Book 103: Dracula
--- Step 6: Category Tree ---
python
Copy code
Fiction: Gothic -> ['Dracula', 'Frankenstein']  
Fiction: Classic -> ['Hamlet', 'Rebecca']  
Children: Fantasy -> ['Matilda']
--- Step 7: Binary Tree (In-order Traversal - Alphabetical Order) ---
['Hamlet', 'Rebecca', 'Dracula', 'Matilda', 'Frankenstein', 'Carrie', 'Emma']
